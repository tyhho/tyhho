### About

I am a molecular biologist and bacterial synthetic biologist by training. Firm believer in computer literacy and automation, and code from time to time for my research (Python) and for vounteering work at [iDEC](https://idec.io) (HTML, CSS and a bit of Django, limited Vanilla JS). Enjoy learning and problem solving by DIY (code or 3D designs), and hence some repositories here are my collections of fixes to trivial but irratating issues in everyday work.
