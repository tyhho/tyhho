### About

Molecular biologist and bacterial synthetic biologist by training.  
  
Firm believer in computer literacy and automation, and code from time to time for my research (Python) and for vounteering work at [iDEC](https://idec.io) (HTML, CSS and a bit of Django, limited Vanilla JS).  
  
Enjoy learning and problem solving by DIY (programming or 3D CAD and printing), and hence some repositories here showcase my fixes to trivial but irratating issues in everyday work.
